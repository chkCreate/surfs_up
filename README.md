# Surfs-Up-Analysis
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
  
W.Avy has commissioned us to analyze temperature trends to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We analyzed temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. 
  
## Results
  
From the analysis, there were three major points from the two analysis deliverables.

* First, see the June and December statistic results below. One clearly good data point shared between both months is that the average temperature is around the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit. This suggests that for most June and December months, you can expect mild and warm temperatures, and therefore, favorable to surfing and ice cream business.

* For the month of June, the minimum temperature is 64 Fahrenheit, which is an acceptable temperature of surfing, and ice cream partially. December months are not too cold as well, with the minimum of 56 Fahrenheit from more than 1500 datapoints. 
  
* Both June and December months do not differ much in standard deviation, which suggests that most ranges of temperature spread around a similar number of frequency.
   
## Summary
  
Starting a surf and ice cream business in Oahu is highly recommended to W.Avy.
  
As for two additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December, I would be interested in rainfall data and windspeed data. High volumes or frequent rainfall and/or wind can suggest extreme weather or "bad" weather for surfing or ice cream.
