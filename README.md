# Surfs-Up-Analysis
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
  
W.Avy has commissioned us to analyze temperature trends to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We analyzed temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. 
  
## Results
  
From the analysis, there were three major points from the two analysis deliverables.

* Senior Engineers and Senior Staffs are leaving the company at the highest numbers, a little over 28,000 employees as you can see in the figure 1 below. These positions need to focused on the most to fill the void in the next few years. The employees at the next level down (ex. Engineer and Staff) should be paired up with current employees reaching retirement age in a mentorship program.

* Engineers and Staff leaving with the "silver tsunami" are in between 12,000 and 14,000. So those employees in that pool should be excluded from those included in the training efforts. 
  
* Technique Leaders and Assistant Engineers need to be filled in as well, but their numbers range from 1,000 to 5,000. At least 4 or 5 times less critical to fill than the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles. 
  
* One good review of the data is that there are only two Managers leaving the company in the "silver tsunami". Efforts to recruit new employees and mentorship can remain minimal for now. 
  
## Summary
  
There were two questions raised regarding the upcoming "silver tsunami:
  
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  
90,398 roles for Staff, Senior Staff, Assistant Engineer, Engineer, Senior Engineer, Technique Leader, and Manager would have to be filled to maintain the same number of roles with the exit of retiring employees. You can see the specific number of roles that need to be filled per title in the figure 1 above.
  
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  
There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employess in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees. See figure 2 below, which shows the total of employees eligible for mentorship per title. Comparing the number of employees getting ready for retirement and the number of employees eligible for mentorships, the average ratio is 63, which suggests that one mentor would have to train around 63 employees for their roles. It is highly recommended that the mentorship program is in place as soon as possible and increase efforts for recruitment as well.
